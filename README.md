Original implmentation: [https://github.com/ulabox/money](https://github.com/ulabox/money).
This library replaces the yaml-configuration for the doctrine object mapping with annotations. This way you can reference the provided Value Objects as "@Embeddable"-s inside your entities.

Do not use this library directly, but fork it instead as I might clean up its git history at one point.
